# Karma examples

This folder contains small, self-contained snippets that show how to use the
Karma ECS + scene graph from game code.

- `GameInit.cpp`: builds a simple scene with a player, camera, skybox, and audio.
- `GameLoop.cpp`: engine-owned loop with a game interface.
- `imgui_ui_demo.cpp`: ImGui draw data bridge layered over the 3D frame.
- `rmlui_ui_demo.cpp`: RmlUi draw data bridge layered over the 3D frame.
